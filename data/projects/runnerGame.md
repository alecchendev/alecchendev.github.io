description: "A simple 3D platformer game where you traverse levels as fast as you can using a spiderman-esque grappling hook ability. I didn't use a game engine, so I had to work with the graphics directly, and craft my own physics/collision system. It was difficult, but I learned a lot, and I think it turned out pretty well."
