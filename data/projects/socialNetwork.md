description: "Getting into network analysis through research during high school, I collected friendship data through survey responses and wrote an article with my analysis and visualization of the social network of those around me. I tried really hard to break down the raw statistics into more digestible insights, and it was really cool to get responses from classmates that'd read my piece."
