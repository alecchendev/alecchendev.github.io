Hey! I'm Alec.

I'm a student studying computer science at UIUC with a growing interest in distributed systems and cryptography. I currently work at AbbVie as an emerging tech intern with a focus on blockchain-related work.

Outside of tech, I'm interested in all kinds of things, including cooking, nutrition, exercise, and film, to name a few.
