Hey! I'm Alec.

I'm a rising sophomore studying CS at UIUC with a growing interest in the rust programming language, IPFS/the distributed web, and fintech. I currently work at P&G as a software engineer/data science intern.

Outside of programming, my other interests include cooking, nutrition, film, and reading.
