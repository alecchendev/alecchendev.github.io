Hey! I'm Alec.

I'm a student studying computer science at UIUC with a growing interest in web3, crypto, and decentralized systems. I currently work at AbbVie as an emerging tech intern with my main focus being on blockchain-related work.

Outside of tech, my other interests include cooking, nutrition, film, and reading.
