Hey! I'm Alec.

I'm a student studying computer science at UIUC with a growing interest in distributed/decentralized systems and cryptography. I currently work at AbbVie as an emerging tech intern with a focus on blockchain-related work.

Outside of tech, my other interests include cooking, nutrition, exercise, writing, and video creation.
