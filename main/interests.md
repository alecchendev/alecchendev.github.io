# Interests

These days I can't help but find so many things so interesting. The following are the things I typically explore anytime I get the chance to.
For now I'm mostly just listing topics, but in the future I may expand on what particularly about these topics piques my interest, similar to what I've done in the hobbies page.

If you have recommendations for books, websites, newsletters, YouTube channels, twitter accounts, or anything related to these topics, I'm always excited to find a new way to explore!
Further, if you or someone you know has an interest in any of the topics below don't hesitate to dm or email me! (contact on home page)
