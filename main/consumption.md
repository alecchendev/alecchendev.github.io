# Consumption

A highlight reel of the tv shows, movies, and miscellaneous media I've consumed.
This is not a complete list of all I've gotten through, but a list of media
that has resonated with me in one way or another. Maybe I thought the piece was interesting
or it brought me to tears or it just gave me a good laugh; somehow I've found any given
item on these lists to be worth the time. Recommendations welcome.

Note: Recently removed books - soon will add other forms of media I consume regularly, e.g. YouTube channels, podcasts, newsletters, websites, artists, etc.
