# Books 

For a while I've seen the value in books, but only recently have I really *realized* the value in the thorough consumption of content in the written form. I'm slowly starting to reflect this realization in my lifestyle, and I figured opening another page on my website would further add to this move.

At the moment I'm looking to build a personal library/canon, however I feel like I'm not well read enough to know which books it would include. So as always, recommendations are welcome.

Note: I don't remember much from the few things I read before my last year or two of high school, so the list starts from that around that point in time.

### Open

These are the books that I'm actively (however spurratically) reading at the time of updating this page.

- Meditations
- The History of Love
- The Death and Life of Great American Cities
- Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time
- Letters From of Stoic
- Amusing Ourselves to Death
- Convenience Store Woman

### Personal Canon

The books I study thoroughly. The books I can return to and continuously derive wisdom or solace from.

- ...TBD

### Past
