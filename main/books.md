# Books 

I discovered books far too late in my life. This page is a testament to my efforts to make up for this fact.

### Open

The books that I'm actively (however sporadically) reading at the time of updating this page.

- The History of Western Philosophy
- Brave New World

### Personal Canon

Currently in the early phase of building this for myself, but my plan is to have a set of books
that I continuously return to and study thoroughly.

- The Conquest of Happiness

### Past

Books I've particularly enjoyed that I've either completed in their entirety or read a substantial amount of (relatively chronological - latest to earliest) *and* thoroughly enjoyed.

- Amusing Ourselves to Death
- The Conquest of Happiness
- Convenience Store Woman
- Sapiens
- Flowers For Algernon
- Deep Work
- On Writing
- Show Your Work
- The War of Art
- Outliers
- Catcher in the Rye
- The War On Normal People
- Paper Menagerie
- Animal Farm
