# Books 

I discovered books far too late in my life. This page is a testament to my efforts to make up for this fact.

### Open

- The Death and Life of Great American Cities
- Work: A History of How We Spend Our Time
- Amusing Ourselves to Death
- Where the Wizards Stay Up Late
- The Conquest of Happiness
- The History of Western Philosophy (soon to begin)

### Personal Canon

The books I return to and continuously derive wisdom and/or solace from.
