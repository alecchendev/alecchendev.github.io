- [No Boilerplate on mediation and yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gZdTZa8bOw). He described it as being especially helpful for programmers because meditation helps you have more control over your thoughts (which can be distractions you can’t do away with by putting on headphones or deleting an app). He also described yoga as exercises that help you be able to sit for longer periods of time without discomfort. I have been struggling with both of these lately, maybe I should revisit.

- Realizing in my example of YouTube manipulating my actions: would it really be helpful to see the source code behind youtube’s reccomendation algorithm? It’s definitely helpful to be able to control it yourself, but idk. I guess the big thing is it’s more transparent, and people being able to have videos surfaced how they choose is the important part.
