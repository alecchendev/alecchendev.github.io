- [Chaincode research website](https://research.chaincode.com/research-intro/) is awesome!

- Forgot about this website: [bitcoin development philosophy](https://bitcoin-dev-philosophy.github.io/btcphilosophy/).
- This is also fire: [A friendly introduction to bitcoin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i4Ipk3Z7NwdUEHzavx5K9SVAMs5s2dQWyfzauk98H80/edit#slide=id.p)
- Okay, need to stop surfing links and get to work lol.
- Made changes to my PR.
- Stumbled across [Bitcoin Core’s productivity notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/productivity.md).
- `cargo tree` shows dependency tree of your cargo project!
- Saw Code to the Moon’s [video about emacs org mode](https://youtu.be/cxoE2FhOIgI), rather than being interested in Doom Emacs, I discovered corne keyboards which seem super cool. Agh, how to balance between actually doing stuff and optimizing my workflow!?
