- Did a bunch of refactoring of my cryptopals repository. Separated challenge implementations into modules by topic while leaving the actual tests in main to have a single place with every challenge in order so you don’t have to go searching for them. Also now that I’ve done a bunch of similar challenges I can generalize some parts to make things cleaner.
