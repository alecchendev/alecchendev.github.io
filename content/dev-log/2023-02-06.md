- Can easily derive `std::error::Error` trait on a custom error with [`thiserror`](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/#derives) crate

- Feeling pumped to get back to contributing this week. I think I’m doing a good job of finding balance between code review, making PRs, and building with/using the software (even though I’ve only done a little of each).
- Helix: `space d` for diagnostic picker, great for going straight to compilation errors.
    - Would be nice to have a “change picker” in helix, so I could easily cycle through all my changes. Probably something exists in git I just don’t know how.
- Use single quotes for git commit messages [to avoid shell execution of backticks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71155954/backticks-in-git-commit-message)
- Cargo has built in benchmarking with `cargo bench`! (also done in CI)…but I don’t get the nice time tables…
- New thing to look out for when making a PR: fuzzing. Command: `cd fuzz && RUSTFLAGS="--cfg=fuzzing" cargo test --verbose --color always`
- Got through [my PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2016) and it has a [6x speedup for reading the network graph](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2016#pullrequestreview-1286186534)! It was pretty simple though, [the heavy lifting](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1107) was already done a while ago hehe. I think the real value was just recognizing that there was potential for speed up here (which again was not done by me lol). Nevertheless, feels good to help out!
    - Note to self: look for more issues like this! I can still learn from them, and I can maximize my effort:being helpful ratio.
- Working on [cryptopals challenge 16](https://www.cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/16) and I’m sort of curious about how this would work in a real context, because I imagine they have some sort of other santization/checks on the decrypted plaintext before returning the padding error. I guess not? Or at least, in the famous case they didn’t (these days I feel like it’d be caught much more easily).
    - Finished all of cryptopals set 2 and excited for set 3!
