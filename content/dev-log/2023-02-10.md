- [Motion canvas](https://motion-canvas.github.io/) is cool! Maybe I can make some animations to help with my Bitcoin talks later in the semester.

- Finished cryptopals challenges 17 and 18. 17 was the famous CBC padding oracle attack which Iâ€™d done in my computer security class, also after set 2 I feel so familiar with these CBC problems it was really not that hard. 18 was just implementing counter mode for AES and it was pretty elegant.
