- It’s already March!

- For a while I’ve had the thought that another prime example use case for a blockchain is something like voting for political election. Something that’d be best for anyone to be able to verify. But I’m realizing this probably doesn’t even need a blockchain, i.e. you don’t really care about order, you just care about the count. You would still care about consensus, and I wonder how you would deal with conflicts…Also really have no idea how you’d deal with sybil attacks here and also privacy probably requires some zero-knowledge stuff.
- Updated my website finally.
- Taking a bit of a break today because it’s really nice out and I’ve been feeling some back/eye strain from the past couple days.
- Random tools I ran into: [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides), [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), [graph-easy](https://github.com/ironcamel/Graph-Easy), [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)
