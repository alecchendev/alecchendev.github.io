- Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbhL5RqL8Aw). Didn’t really learn anything in particular, but got some broad exposure to how lightning is integrated into enterprise software.

- Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9KMRWkcwtE). Learned Bitcoin core has this concept of no free relay. Whenever you are replacing other transactions with a new transaction, you have to pay 1 satoshi/vByte that you are replacing in fees. If you didn’t have to do this, you could DDoS the network by repeatedly sending transactions and replacing them with negligibly higher fees and forcing everyone to waste tons of CPU bandwidth. This makes things tricky with anchor outputs because your counterparty can sneak transactions into the mempool that are unnecessarily large to force you to pay more.
- Read [this article](https://lightningdevkit.org/blog/onion-messages-demystified/). Seems kinda just like normal onion routing but with rendezvous routing? Refreshed myself on how normal onion routing works from [this article](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/sphinx.md): source-based routing, encrypts each step along the way, then sends whole packet to be decrypted one by one, uses special scheme to obfuscate packet size/position in path. What’s the difference between blinded routes and rendezvous?
- Refreshed myself on [vByte/weight-unit terminology](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units#History). vByte = 4 weight units. Max block size = 1 MvByte = 1,000,000 vBytes = 4,000,000 weight units. Legacy (non-segwit) transactions byte and vByte sizes were the same. Segwit transactions allowed for parts of the transaction (mainly the witnesses) to have a byte = 1 weight unit instead of 4, which is how the block size was covertly increased in Segwit.
    - Note: I previously thought the max block size is 2MB, but that’s actually just generally an upper limit for average block size. The actual max block size is 4,000,000 weight units, which can be up to ~4MB, but only if transactions are formatted super weirdly.
    - Another side note: [kB = 1024B = 1000B](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/bits-gigabytes.html#alternate).
- Learned a bit about [Signet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0325.mediawiki). Another test network that is meant to be “predictably unreliable,” and it requires an extra signature commitment something witness for a valid block. Will look into this more some other time.
- `[pub(crate)` notation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html). Can make something
- [Crates and modules in Rust overview](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/crates-and-modules.html). More in [the textbook](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html).
- Surfed the [issues on ldk-sample-node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample/issues) repo. Might be an even better place to start than rust-lightning good first issues.
