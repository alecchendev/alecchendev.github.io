- Was thinking more about [my PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2062) and received a new comment - decided to go with the suggestion. While doing this I explored the other LN implementations for the first time. It was surprisingly not too difficult to find what I was looking for, besides being in different languages and massive repos.

- Did some OCaml with a friend’s homework. Pretty interesting.
- New LSP from TBD, [c=](https://cequals.xyz/)! (c= is meant to be speed of light, get it, because *light*ning network infra)
- Learned vim tabs exist. Was thinking I was going to use harpoon, but this will be much simpler, and it’s straight out of the box
- [Probably the most compelling piece](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-case-for-privacy/) I’ve read on privacy. [Another piece on bitcoin privacy pre-history](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/digital-cash-and-privacy/).
- I should maybe consider applying for a [TABConf](https://2023.tabconf.com/) 2023 grant. Would be super cool to go.
- Learned what [mutation testing](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants) is. Almost like testing your tests. Make a particular change to a function, and if you’re tests still pass, it means your tests fail to cover a particular case.
- Started exploring more for summer of bitcoin stuff - looked through other LN project ideas, started browsing more LDK issues and roadmap. Got distracted by [Gigi’s 21 lessons](https://21lessons.com/).
