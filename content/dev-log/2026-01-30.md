- it's tragic my favorite ice cream shop, [nicecream](https://www.nicecream.com/), closed down their brick and mortar location. I was thinking to myself, is there any alternative business model where they could capitalize on superfans like me to make things more sustainable? Tiered models have become pretty normal for internet products but like, this is food. If we need fancier business models for stuff like this, it feels like we're doing something wrong
