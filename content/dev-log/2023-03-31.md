- How to kick CI: general note for devs - you don't have to rebase to pick up ci fixes - if you just kick ci to run again (or do a dummy git commit --amend && git push -f) ci will run with a rebased copy for you.

- Opened [new PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2142)!
- Notes on main places where `Event::PaymentFailed` gets pushed:
    - `OutboundPayment::abandon_payment` - gets called when the user calls `ChannelManager::abandon_payment`, but also used as a helper in retry logic (`retry_payment_internal` + `handle_pay_route_err`)

    - `OutboundPayment::fail_htlc` - gets called whenever there's an error after a payment is actually sent, i.e. either the recipient rejected the payment or some node along the route failed to forward
    - `OutboundPayment::check_retry_payments` - main place payments are retried
