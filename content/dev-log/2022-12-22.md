- Learned about `cargo clean`. `cargo build` creates the `target` folder with build artifacts, but these can get corrupted/outdated and cause build problems. `cargo clean` just removes this directory from what I can tell which forces cargo to rebuild from scratch which can solve this build issues. ChatGPT helped me discover this when I was having build problems on Rust 1.48.0 but no compilation errors.

- Did quite a bit of refactoring today in my PR I’ve been working on. Feeling pretty good about my changes now. Feel like the code is pretty readable. Main thing I could see feedback being on is just the practicality of this whole PR, i.e. is it really necessary to add this functionality to what is meant to be a relatively simple sample node; is it adding too much complexity? We’ll see. Got a maintainer to approve running CI and it passed. Hopefully will get some feedback tomorrow morning and I can get this merged sometime in the near future. Getting closer to my first contribution!
- Becoming more and more familiar with all the ways to unwrap and handle `Result` and `Option`. Check out this block:
    
    ```rust
    get_rpc_auth_from_cookie(None, Some(network), None)
        .or(get_rpc_auth_from_env_file(None))
        .or(get_rpc_auth_from_env_vars())
        .or({
            println!("ERROR: unable to get bitcoind RPC username and password");
            print_rpc_auth_help();
            Err(())
        })?
    ```
    
    Pretty nice right?
