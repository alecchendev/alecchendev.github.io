- Got some feedback on my [PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1948)! The maintainers are really generous with there time. It’s making getting started with the repo a great experience.

- My intuition was right about [the `cltv_expiry` wanting to be decreased for the HTLC](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1878#issuecomment-1381229722) in submarine swaps! I was pretty confused, but it makes sense now.
- Struggling to test. Sort of annoying iteration is slow because I think it’s compiling every single test even when I am only running a single test. Sucks to not have my monitor right now either, my laptop screen is so small while navigating all this code.
- Slowly in-taking more in-depth knowledge of lightning. Read part of BOLT 4 today for the failure messages section.
