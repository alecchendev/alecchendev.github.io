- Had a migraine for the first time this morning. Very painful. Taking it easy today.

- Did cryptopals challenge 13. These challenges are often not super clear in their directions…I guess that’s sorta the point haha. Because we’re writing our own tests and whatnot, it’s sometimes just not clear exactly what we’re trying to do or what the context is, but eventually I end up figuring it out.
- Praying my headache resolves tomorrow morning!
