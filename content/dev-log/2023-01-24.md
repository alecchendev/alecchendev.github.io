- [Reviewed the Dual funding PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1794#pullrequestreview-1268261476)!

- Learned a little bit about [discrete log contracts](https://www.dlc.wiki/). Use a trusted third party oracle as a way of getting external data on-chain in order to do “real” contracts.
- Got my question [answered](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/608#issuecomment-812094253) about the weird failure code stuff in BOLT 4. The certain probing attack in the [failure messages section](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md#failure-messages) was more relevant (specifically to LND) before payment secrets became a thing. Surprised this even got merged because it seems like more of an implementation issue.
- Learned this a bit ago but forgot to include it in a dev log: Payment secret was added as something to validate MPP. The payment hash is communicated to each node along the route (in order to form correct HTLCs), but the payment secret is only known by the sender and receiver and is used to validate the payment, and can be “split up” for MPP.
- A `point` type when talked about in the BOLTs corresponds to a public key. Kinda confused now, but I guess they’re all just 32 byte numbers so..?
