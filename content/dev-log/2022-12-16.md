- I tested out the [LDK sample node](https://lightningdevkit.org/running-a-sample-ldk-node/) and played around with it interacting with polar.

- I watched [this walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6C8pjcMixo) of the main code for the sample node on bitcoin developers youtube channel.
- I learned a bit about how LDK was used to bring [lightning to cash app](https://lightningdevkit.org/blog/cashapp-enables-lightning-withdrawals-and-deposits-using-ldk/).
