- More stuff on my PR

    - Make sure amounts work for both MPP and non-mpp

        - wait but…what if you have a double claim situation, but you overpaid the first time, and now you send a different amount - if you set total_msat to the actual amount upon pushing PaymentClaimable, you’ll refuse to claim the resent payments

        - Why keep the check in claim_funds as < rather than ≠: because in case HTLCs timeout and the sender resends in between generating PaymentClaimable and the user responding to the event, you’d still want to
    - Writing tests is still hard but I’m getting better at it!
- Review: `ref` is used in pattern matching when you want a reference to the inside value as opposed to matching/dereferencing a reference with the `&` sign.
- Spent a bunch of time time writing some tests that didn’t get used :)
