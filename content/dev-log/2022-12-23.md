- `git commit --fixup <commit-hash>`. A maintainer left some feedback mentioning they usually do “fixup” commits while iterating on review. Didn’t know this was a thing but that’s cool and more versatile/looks better than force pushes.

- Started using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) terminal a bit. Sorta inconvenient it’s not right inside my VS Code, but there’s maybe a way to get the features inside there..? Nice to have the better visualized autocomplete. Otherwise need to explore more.
- Got a bit of feedback on my PR and responded to it. Feels good to have some more back and forth, and I think it will probably get merged sometime after Christmas and whatnot.
- Figured out a way to test on Windows today. Seems that there is no way to easily run windows on a mac, which I guess makes sense. But there *is* an easy way to run linux on both mac and windows, that being docker. [This](https://github.com/StefanScherer/windows-docker-machine) seemed like too much work, so I spun up a Windows EC2 instance on AWS which makes you connect using remote desktop client which was super slow. However, I did feel pretty empowered by the fact I was able to do something I’d never done before pretty quickly/easily.
