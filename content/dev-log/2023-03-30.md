- Things left on this issue (didn’t get a lot of time to work on this today)
    - Finish places that need to be changed to take a reason

    - Make draft PR
        - Questions: Are all these variants unnecessary?

            - Either could get rid of them or lump retry stuff under an enum? or just lump together?
        - Note: RecipientRejected currently also accounts for when there’s just a path failure (like in the intercepted onion tests, it’s not necessarily the recipient rejected, but there was a path failure)
        - Doesn’t seem like it’s easily differentiable from where `PaymentFailed` events are pushed - different retry strategies being exhausted, recipientrejected or forwarding failed
    - Fix tests
        - First fix the individual places, then the generalized functions

            - Prob good to add payment path failed → see pathfailed event

            - In `do_automatic_retries`, the retry strategy timeout is different from the normal route_params/payment_params timeout
            - Another thing making it hard to do this is for example `do_automatic_retries` `AutoRetry::FailOnReload` - how would we know if we reloaded?? (maybe this is answerable, but I’m defaulting here)
            - Uh in `no_extra_retries_on_back_to_back_fail` is the `bs_fail_update` actually mean bs? Like is this correct for the failure reason to be recipient rejected?
        - Two approaches: 1. try to refactor current test methods to include checking for a reason, 2. just write a separate test checking all the reasons and ignore it in current tests
        - No tests for RetryParameterError or RetryAmountOverflow (in outbound_payments.rs)
