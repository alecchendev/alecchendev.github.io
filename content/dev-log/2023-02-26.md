- Finished set 3 of cryptopals! Challenge 24 was kind of weird. It was mainly creating a stream cipher with the PRNG and then breaking just with normal brute force which seemed sort of unfulfilling. I looked it up to see if I was misunderstanding and other people seemed to have come to similar conclusions.

- I always hear people talk about how things are wrong with our *financial system*. I’ve never really understood this side. I get how inflating the money supply is bad, and I get how trusted intermediaries in payments cause issues, and how secure self-custody is important, but I imagine the type of experiences the people at a place like Square have encountered dealing with the financial system are different in how they reveal it’s flaws. I want to learn more about this.
- Also want to understand more about the idea of “the blockchain only being used to settle disputes”
- Rip neovim slowing down on this 10K line file, but helix doesn’t 👀
