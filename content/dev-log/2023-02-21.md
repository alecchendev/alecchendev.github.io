- Signal vs telegram open source - signal is full open source, i.e. they open source their clients running on your phone *and* the code on their servers (technically can't verify they are running the same code but seeing the code gives higher assurances, it also means you could run your own signal server which is sick (and I've run a proxy before and if it’s similar, it's fairly easy to switch what server your client points to), telegram does NOT open source their server code which is SUS but they have client code and their encryption protocol open sourced (and includes clear instructions for verifiable builds which I gotta pay my respects for) and honestly i feel like if people have audited the protocol then it shouldn't matter what the server is running if it complies with the protocol it should be secure...although they may be collecting lots of other metadata on messages like WhatsApp which could be problematic.

- For existing branches such as branches fetched from other remote repositories, create a worktree through the `git worktree add <path> <branch>` command. The default `git worktree add <path>` will create a new branch/worktree.
- You can resize your window in Vim with `:resize <char-count>` and resize horizontally with `:vert` at the beginning
