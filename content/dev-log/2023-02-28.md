- Clarifying for myself on intended behavior of `test_dup_htlc_second_rejected`. This doesn’t test if a second HTLC overruns the amount it will fail but the first will be claimable, it tests if a payment is already been claimable and you get a duplicate that the first will remain claimable and the duplicate will be failed (same things but nuanced)

- Have not been doing a good job documenting last couple days. That’s okay! Been heads down making [this PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2062)!
- Interesting, learned about different payment reversals: [article,](https://www.chargebackgurus.com/blog/payment-reversals) [article](https://www.tidalcommerce.com/learn/payment-reversal). Authorization reversal is reversing a payment after it’s been initiated but not settle through ACH and this is the easiest/cleanest reversal. A refund is exactly what it sounds like: the payment has been settled, now the merchant is abiding by some policy and has to send the funds back in a new transaction. They lose out on the sale, the cost of the product they lost, as well as the fees for both transactions. A chargeback is as bad as a refund but worse because there’s a dispute. Merchants also incur extra chargeback fees, need to fight fraudulent claims, and if they face too many chargebacks the credit card networks can flag them and revoke their ability to accept credit cards. Financial institutions using the card networks are tasked with monitoring chargeback thresholds to prevent fraudulent merchants.
