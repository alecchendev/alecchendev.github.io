- In electronics, they start with Ohm's law, but in electromagnetism, they start with Maxwell's equations. It makes sense, just kinda interesting
- They call them maxwell's equations but two of them are named after gauss, one after faraday. The only one maxwell is on is a half credit with ampere. But his synthesis of these disparate equations into the unified theory of electromagnetism is what put his name on all of them.
- I've asked this before, but...waves, current, charges in particles. All electromagnetism, but also different. How do they all connect? I'm getting closer to explaining this over time.
