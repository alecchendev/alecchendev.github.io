- Got a weighted blanket and silverware for Christmas! Win!

- Watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGOiiR9ZKg) on composition vs. inheritance. Seems it usually makes your code more adaptable when you use interfaces over abstract parent classes, as it’s easy to change a class to implement or not implement an interface, but if you want to change something about an abstract class, you likely need to change many things about your child classes. The downside of interfaces being if you have a lot of boilerplate, a parent class would be nice there. Not sure about many other languages, but I know in Rust you can implement default behavior for traits which seems kinda like a best of both worlds.
    - Really liking this channel! This is the kind of style of educational videos I would like to make about lightning concepts. Thinking the basics of what he’s doing are reproducible in a software like keynote.
