- There is a [reccommended character wrap of 100 chars](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1445#discussion_r868626919)!

- Started on 2 things
    - MPP overshooting

    - Summer of bitcoin project scoping
- A tool I would really want
    - Feed codebase into AI → ask questions

    - Example questions: I’m looking to do this, are there functions available that do this?
- I should maybe try harpoon, because my monitor isn’t exorbantly large, and rust-lightning got some long lines that make split screen not that great, and it is true I’m am very often switching between just a couple files on the fly
- I am honestly quite impressed with my previous self with the [test I wrote in my first PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1948/files#diff-d1765ac33bf9bc310eaf7780cabf8dcda5e2049b78a77aa4611264d47f0c7e5d). It’s a bit of a struggle navigating how to do exactly what I want because every function automatically does a bunch of checks that I might not necessarily want.
- Mainly working on [this](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2012) all evening.
