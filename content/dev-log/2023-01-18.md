- Got some more feedback on my PR, implemented it, marked it ready for review.

- Learned `git show` and `git diff`. [Difference between them](https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/ig9e86/git_diff_vs_git_show_and_ranges/), show is for single commits, diff is more generic and can do branches or any two commits. `git show` shows change for latest commit. `git diff <target-branch>..<working-branch>` is nice to see what your pull request is looking like.
- Learned [how to revert a merge](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7099833/how-do-i-revert-a-merge-commit-that-has-already-been-pushed-to-remote).
- Learned to [rebase instead of merging main](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#rebasing-changes) branch into working branch. In all honesty I can’t believe I didn’t know this before lol. Also realizing how nice rebasing is to just organize your different commits in your branch—will be doing this by default now.
- What is a phantom payment? I see this all around the repository but I don’t actually know what it is.
- Was reading [some documentation about failure codes](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md#failure-messages) (PERM|15) where it talked about the fact that they returned differentiating errors in certain cases, it allowed for a forwarding node to be able to probe nodes with HTLCs of different amounts or cltv_expiry’s in order to find out the final destination. Pretty neat.
- Started on cryptopals. Did the first 4 challenges of set 1. So far they were pretty simple, but I sometimes would get caught up overengineering or thinking it was harder than it was. Lacking GitHub Copilot here has been very annoying, and my Helix autocomplete always has somewhat of a delay. Will need to look into that…
- Got a bunch of PRs to review after asking in the discord. Exciting!
