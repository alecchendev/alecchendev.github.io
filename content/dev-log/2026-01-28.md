- Why is metal both conductive for electricity *and* heat?
- Learned a bit of ice cream mechanics. Main variations in execution: churn speed, frequency of agitation, and speed at which the base freezes. There's sort of two outcome knobs as I see it: size of ice crystals, and amount of air incorporated. The less air, the more dense, but you don't want to go outside the 20-70% air range. By churning slower, you incorporate less air and it gets denser, say for something like gelato. Frequency of agitation is a spectrum from constantly agitating until it's creamy vs. doing rounds of churning and sitting in the freezer. The more continuously you churn vs. let it sit in the freezer, the smaller the ice crystals will be, and the more creamy it will be (as opposed to being more liquidy/icy). This makes me understand why a machine is so nice, since it can churn slow or fast, continuously, while still freezing. This also explains why certain chemical methods like dry ice or liquid nitrogen can work, because when the freezing time is fairly quick, it makes it easier to have constant agitation for the full freezing duration (there's definitely more to the chemical methods, but that seems like it might play a role). I learned this because I tried making ice cream recently and I botched it. Will be incorporating some learnings into the next batch.
