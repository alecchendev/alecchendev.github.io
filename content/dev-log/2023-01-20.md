- Not doing much today.

- Did the last two challenges in cryptopals set 1.
- Still feeling really intimidated doing things. I want to take action to get better, do better work.
- Weaknesses of mine that stand out right now:
    - Lack of understanding of what users of rust-lightning face

    - Lack of familiarity with the nitty gritty details of the protocol
    - Lack of familiarity with the repository
- Setting out my plan to keep putting more lightning stuff in my brain:
    - Read Mastering lightning (again) to get a good overview of everything.

        - Enhance my comprehension by looking at the bolts and rust-lightning implementation. This will hopefully help me become more familiar with the codebase as well as the technical details.
    - Take some time before jumping into your next issue. You can contribute by doing lots of code review, and when you feel comfortable, and can understand an issue through and through, resume.
    - In the meantime keep your rust skills sharp just working on the cryptopals challenges.
