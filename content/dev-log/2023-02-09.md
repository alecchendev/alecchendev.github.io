- [So it seems *automated* retries are necessary for trampoline](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2008#issuecomment-1424661862). But I’m wondering, could a user have implemented that themselves before..? Regardless it makes sense for LDK to supoort it internally instead of making users do that.

    - Unsafe just means compiler isn’t checking for certain things like needing mutable references to modify things. It’s actually common to use unsafe rust for optimizations when you can prove soundness of it’s usage.

    - [Monads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2704652/monad-in-plain-english-for-the-oop-programmer-with-no-fp-background). Still don’t totally understand the more theoretical functional programming side of things, but I learned to look for concise helpful functions on wrapped types like `Option` and `Result` to avoid having to unwrap to do stuff.
    - [Rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/index.html) for some helpful parallelism tools.
    - `&impl Trait` should be the default when taking a type that implements a trait as a parameter. Often people will use generics with trait constraints, but these are less readable.
    - Be careful with `Deref`! You can call a method of the inner type on a `Arc<_>` just using the normal dot notation because it implements `Deref`. However note: if the inner type implements something like `Clone`, calling `.clone()` will call the inner type’s clone method, and instead you may want to use `Arc::clone(_)`!
