- An experiment to measure the propagation speed of gravity: 2 spaceships. 1 is really large, say the size of a planet. Other is any mass. move spaceship 1, and measure the movement of spaceship 2, whether it moves in the direction of spaceship 1 at the current moment or where it was x time ago. Need large distances maybe. Wonder if there's a scaled dow version you could perform on earth with very precise measurement. There probably is..
