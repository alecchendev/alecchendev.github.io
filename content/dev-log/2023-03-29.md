- Cryptopals challenge 31 - timing attack.

- Trying out [this issue](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/2095)
    - outboundpayment.abandon_payment is called in many different places

        - For this we’ll probably have to create another function - abandon_with_reason

        - In retry_payment_internal there are a bunch of fail conditions - is it useful to actually communicate all these? Maybe? Otherwise could just lump under a RetryError variant and tell them to check logs
    - outboundpayment.fail_htlc is also called in different places
        - this is mainly called by fail_htlc_backwards_internal which is called in many places - hard to narrow down when source = Outbound

        - sigh, need to add another function here too?
        - or maybe can do smth fancy like return the event or something and push the thing with the reason outside this function?
    - check_retry is really only called in one place ✅
    - Need to fix tests - mainly the macro expect_payment_failed
    - Important thing to note
        - outbound_payment::send_payment_internal is the only one that uses the handle_route_err which is the one that abandons based on `PaymentSendFailure` because it will want to retry - this is only used when you use `send_payment_with_retry`

            - For immediate errors this instead sends `RetryableSendFailure`
        - `OutboundPayment::send_payment_with_route` is the one that’s used in the normal `ChannelManager::send_payment` which will not do any retries for you and will immediately return the `PaymentSendFailure` on err
