- Important thing as a programmer: breaking the habit of just doing things without thinking about them. In some cases of course it’s the opposite, i.e. you overengineer—when thinking of implementing something I think it’s better to jump into trying to implement it. However when debugging, I think it’s better to just take a second to think, *what am I trying to find? will doing this help me learn this?* It’s tempting to just go fast, but it’s easy to do a bunch of stuff that doesn’t actually get you any closer to finding the bug.
