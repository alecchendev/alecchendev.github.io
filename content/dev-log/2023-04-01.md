- Finishing up the timing attacks for cryptopals challenges 31 and 32. Question: why would someone even put a wait of any kind while checking the HMAC? Answer: after checking out the [wikipedia page for timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack) I realize this is just simulating a timing attack where if you can uncover that there is a distinguishable difference in execution time between different inputs (and in the challenges, specifically for right and wrong bits in a sequence), you may be able to do a timing attack as one kind of side channel attack. Cool!
