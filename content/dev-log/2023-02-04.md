- [Posted my cryptopals implementations](https://github.com/alecchendev/cryptopals-rust) so far if people want to check them out. Would be cool to eventually refactor this repo to be just tests with empty functions for people to implement. I feel like making the tests yourself is kind of part of the exercise but it’d also be nice to not have to.

- Yes, electrs built! See https://github.com/romanz/electrs/issues/753 for M1
- [Installed electrs.](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/install.md)
- Also briefly tested by electrs setup with [bdk-cli](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli).
- My command for electrs:
    
    ```bash
    ./target/release/electrs --network=regtest --daemon-dir=/Users/alecchen/Library/Application\ Support/Bitcoin --log-filters INFO
    ```
    
- My command to run bitcoind for electrs (pretty basic):
    
    ```bash
    bitcoind -regtest -server -daemon
    ```
    
- It was great to set up my own electrs server, but I think nigiri is winning out for my development setup.
- Building with LDK:
    - `Filter::register_output` function signature no longer has return type
    - The filter section is not super clear, or at least I am unsure what to do just from the docs that are here.
- [Great article on why Breez is using Neutrino + choice of full node](https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-only-thing-better-than-minimal-trust-is-none-at-all-34456f650332). [Great article comparing all the trust models for wallets](https://medium.com/@jimpo/flavors-of-bitcoin-wallets-82e527248d13).
    - Honestly can’t really make up my mind on the matter. Generally however, it seems BIP 157/158 clients are better than Electrum, because Electrum is essentially just SPV. It seems to me all of these light clients suffer from the same issues of just not being a full node and validating consensus, and vary more subtly on privacy etc. So you really just want to make sure that you are connected to an honest full node. Only way to really guarentee that is either by running your own node (not available for certain resource contrained circumstances) or by connecting to different full nodes/servers.
- Completed cryptopals challenge 14. 15 and 16 don’t look too bad. Almost done with set 2!
- Haven’t checked the chaincode slack in a while - stumbled upon [this search tool](https://bitcoinsearch.xyz/?q=what%20happens%20when%20all%20bitcoin%20are%20mined&size=n_50_n) which is hella cool.
