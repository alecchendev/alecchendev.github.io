- Reviewed [rust-lightning contributing guide](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/5221e4a861687751c92d79cf3a54bb9cc1f7aee2/CONTRIBUTING.md) again as I’m getting ready to open that first PR on the repo.

- This seems valuable: [Learn Bitcoin from the command-line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
- This also seems valuable: [cryptopals](https://www.cryptopals.com/). Could be good to do if I’m not writing much code at any point.
- [Jon Atack’s website](https://jonatack.github.io/) has convinced me even further to try to do a lot more review as I onboard to open-source. LDK probably doesn’t have as much resource-constraint as Bitcoin Core when it comes to review, but it really seems like a great way to learn and contribute value at the same time.
- [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/). Seems cool.
- Need to return to [LDK meeting notes](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/wiki/Meeting-Notes) in the future to help direct my efforts towards what I might review.
- Opened a [draft PR](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1948), and [made a comment](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1878#issuecomment-1379765998) asking about submarine swaps and using u16 vs u32 on a different PR. First step into doing more code review.
- Discussion in LDK discord - ertain aspects of LDK are very difficult to fuzz/[proptest](https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/intro.html). Don’t exactly understand the details, but fuzzing seems to be an effort they want to improve. Also I don’t really get the difference between fuzzing and proptest.
