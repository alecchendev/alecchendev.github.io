I’ve been winding down for UIUC’s spring break, as I still feel the rhythm of the student’s life. Finished up latest edits from feedback on my PR. I’ve tried to take on a non-”good first issue” and it definitely took a bit more thinking but it’s been a good experience. It’s a fairly small change in the code, but there were a surprising amount of choices to make when implementing these few small changes. Thankfully I can always get feedback from reviewers. I spent a lot of time going back and forth in the spec to understand what needed to be changed, and I got some more practice writing functional tests.

I’ve also been looking into a new issue about watchtowers, and although I haven’t spent a ton of time with it I’ve found a new part of the repo that I haven’t explored much yet. As always I still have much more to learn!
