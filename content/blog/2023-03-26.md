After a couple of weeks of feeling a bit slow, I’m fired up again! Honestly, it’s crazy I get to work on this stuff, and that I get feedback from the other contributors on this project. One of many cool things about open-source.

I’m feeling like I’m getting a bit more confident and getting used to not taking anything personally. There are a lot of weird emotional nuances with contributing that are not that apparent when I started. At least on rust-lightning, people are very good about communicating positivity/appreciation, so I feel like I’ve been very appreciative of that. Nevertheless, it’s scary to work in public and propose changes and get feedback from people you look up to. I don’t want to look stupid or waste people’s time. Now that I’ve faced these things for some months however, I’m getting more used to them, and it’s cool.

### Sunsetting dev logs

I’m going to stop posting dev logs so regularly. It’s become more of a chore than a tool. Writing generally is still super helpful, but writing as much as I have been has felt like it’s become more of something I feel like I should do to signal that I’m doing work, and it’s a burden. I no longer feel like I value writing so frequently/elaborately in my day to day.
