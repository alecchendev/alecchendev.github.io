subtitle: "At the beginning of this year I set out to become a crypto content creator. That was my resolution: to give a serious go at content creation — something that’s been on my mind for years now."

It’s honestly funny if you see my YouTube and Substack there’s just one lonely post introducing my plans for my content and then nothing else.

The past week I’ve thought about how it’s already been a month into the new year and I’ve completely flopped on my resolution.

It’s not a total surprise. It’s what usually happens with New Year’s resolutions and I happened to not be an exception. But I knew this going into it, and I was totally fine with it. I set goals as a way of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. It’s not about whether a particular throw sticks, but the act of throwing.

I did utterly fail though…in the short term. I think we forget about that last part — especially with New Year’s resolutions. We fail very briefly and give up on the next 90% of the goal.

I’m not full sending every detail of my original goal again, but I’m going to keep at the main idea: **make a return to content creation in 2022.** And I encourage you to do the same!
