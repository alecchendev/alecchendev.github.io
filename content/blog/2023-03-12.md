title: Slowness
---

Generally have felt a bit burnt out lately. Just feel like I don’t understand lightning enough and there’s so much I don’t know, and everyone in Bitcoin knows everything and is a genius and I am not! Of course this isn't totally true, and to the extent that it is, it's okay. Nevertheless this is how I feel.

Also have just felt very out of my element being at home. Haven’t been exercising as much, and feel much more distracted. An uptick in my social media consumption also hasn’t helped.

It’s interesting, I was looking back at some of my older dev logs looking for some notes I took, and I noticed there were times I was perfectly okay taking off several days if I was busy with something or just taking a break. I don’t remember feeling particularly anxious or behind back then. I just now feel like I’ve imposed more expectations on myself or something.

Here’s the solution: just focus on learning and doing your best work! This is open-source, it’s asynchronous. It’s okay to take your time as long as you’re actively putting effort in trying to learn.
