title: Ice cream from scratch | 2026 Jan 31
---

### Ingredients

- Flavor: sweet cream
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup cream
- <1/2 cup sugar
- 2-3 egg yolks

### Instructions

- Medium-low heat. Pour milk and sugar in a pot, bring to simmer.
- Separate egg yolks in a small bowl. Pour a little bit of warm milk into the eggs to "temper them." Basically just want to heat them slowly so they don't curdle.
- Low heat. Pour eggs into warm milk and whisk a little.
- No heat. Pour in heavy cream and whisk some more.
- Cool it down. Put this in the fridge for a couple hours, or freezer for some smaller amount of time.
- ...
- Put a bunch of (ideally crushed) ice and salt in a big bowl.
- Take the mix out of the fridge, into a smaller bowl. Place it in the ice salt situation in the big bowl.
- Whisk it fast for like 10 minutes. Put it in the fridge for 30-60min. Do this a total of 4ish times.
- By the end, it should be a soft-serve texture. Put it into an air tight container in the freezer for a while (4h-overnight).
- Enjoy!

### Rationale

- Ice cream is just milk, cream, sugar, and air, frozen slowly while being mixed. Your density comes from how much air gets mixed in, which is determined by how quickly it is mixed. The smoothness of the texture comes from the size of the ice crystals that form, which is determined by how frequently it is mixed, breaking up the ice crystals, as it freezes.
- Protein content can improve these things in a couple ways. They bind to water molecules, reducing ability to crystallize into larger chunks. They also somehow stabilize air incorporation and fat emulsification, tbh I don't fully understand those parts. Eggs vs milk proteins (skim milk, whey) do this in different ways, but supposedly you want some sort of protein content to enhance the bottom line goals.
- If we add eggs, we want to pre-cook them so we're not eating raw eggs. But we don't want them to cook fast, so we don't get literally cooked egg chunks in the ice cream. This is the reason for the whole pre-cooking tempering step.
- It's important to cool the cooked mixture before starting to whisk. The whole point of mixing it is to incorporate air and break up ice crystals as it freezes. If it's way to warm to start freezing, whisking is probably not very effective.
- The timing of sitting in the freezer between whisks depends. You want the mixture to actually start freezing, and a bowl of ice can only get you so far. But you also want to mix it frequently enough that you can break up ice crystals as they form. So if your freezer isn't that cold, you can probably go with freezing for more time. This is why a machine is perfect, because it can continually mix it as it freezes, until it's literally ice cream. You may also need to do more rounds to get a creamier texture. I'm still experimenting.
- A helpful tip to know if your mix is being cooled enough by the ice: there should be some condensation on the inside of the bowl above the level of your mix. If you don't see this, your mix may not be getting cold enough, and/or you may need to add more ice to raise the height.
