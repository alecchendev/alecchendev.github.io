# Hello! I'm Alec.

Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my third-year studying computer science at UIUC (and enjoying it a lot!). I like Bitcoin, and watching Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan. At the moment, I'm planning to take a gap semester in spring 2023 to focus on trying to contribute to the Bitcoin open-source ecosystem (most likely lightning-related).
If you're interested in following my progress, I'll be doing my best to share updates on Twitter.

On the side, lately I've been consuming a lot of urban planning/architecture content and finding it really interesting. I also like to write, and occasionally I'll brave my small corner of the web and publish something.
