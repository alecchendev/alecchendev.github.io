# Hello! I'm Alec.

Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my third-year studying computer science at UIUC (and enjoying it a lot!).
I'm planning to take a gap semester in spring 2023 to focus on trying to contribute to the Bitcoin open-source ecosystem (most likely lightning-related).
If you're interested in following my progress, I plan to post some sort of updates on this website.
