# Hello! I'm Alec.

Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my third-year studying computer science at UIUC (and enjoying it a lot!).
At the moment I'm taking a gap semester to focus on trying to contribute to Bitcoin open-source (most likely lightning-related).
If you're interested in following my progress, check out the rest of this site.
