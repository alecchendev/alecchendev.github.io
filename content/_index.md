# Hello! I'm Alec.

Some things about me: Studied computer science at UIUC. Got really into bitcoin during college, took a gap semester to contribute to [an open-source project](https://github.com/lightningdevkit), worked at [a payments startup](https://www.lightspark.com) for some time. Now work on satellite software at SpaceX.
