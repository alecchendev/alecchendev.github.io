# Hello! I'm Alec.

Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my third year studying computer science at UIUC (and enjoying it a lot!).
I just took a gap semester to contribute to [LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit) and I'm continuing this summer
as a participant in [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).
