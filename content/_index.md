# Hello! I'm Alec.

Welcome to my website! I'm currently in my third-year studying computer science at UIUC. I recently finished working at Palantir this summer as an intern in Washington D.C. I like Bitcoin, and watching Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan. I also like to write, and occasionally I'll brave my small corner of the web and publish something.
