Having gone through the high school to college transition in relatively recent history,
I can share a bit of my experience and things I wish I would've known earlier. I think
people are generally more receptive to advice when they seek it out, so I'm putting this
web page here in case you're ever curious what I might have to say.

If you ever have questions about any of this stuff, I'm always open.

## On getting into college and figuring out what to do with your life

The following pieces are some of the best I've read; ones I read after I had already
spent up most of my time in high school. They all talk about college to some extent,
but more importantly they talk about how to spend your time well, how to figure out what
that means to you, and how to make your life something you enjoy rather than something
you must endure.

- [How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

Besides these, some things I would have found helpful:

- Seriously ask yourself, and try to write down your answers to the following questions:
	- *Why* do you want to study what you want to study?
	- *Why* do you want to go to the school you want to go to?
	- Are you satisfied with your answers to the previous questions?
- Don't wait till college to figure out whether you actually like your major or not. You can
start learning and having fun any time. You'll just feel more stuck the later you do.
