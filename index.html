        Hey! My name is Alec Chen.

        I'm a budding software engineer and CS student at the University of Illinois

            Given 3-4 weeks to just "make something" using C++ and the graphics API
            Cinder, I set out to build the systems behind transforming 3D perspective
            to a 2D screen. After a lot of pacing around my dorm room thinking about
            matrices, I developed a system with simple lighting that could render a
            first person perspective moving and looking around inside of a room, or
            any 3D model made of triangles.

            Putting my newfound React skills to the test, I served as the frontend
            developer on a nutrition recommendation web app that my group called
            Nutribuddy. Working together going through the motions of agile development
            methodologies and practicing proper version control to contribute to a code
            base, we cranked out a pretty sleek MVP that takes in a user's dietary
            preferences and restrictions, and outputs a week's worth of curated meals.

            This was the first project I worked on while learning React. I tried to
            emulate a similar concept of linked databases that my current organization
            app, Notion, uses. It parses the input into the appropriate data, and then
            all the tables are controlled and filtered versions of a single database.

            Getting into network analysis through research during high school, I
            thought it'd be so interesting to analyze the social network of those
            around me. A year later I collected friendship data through survey
            responses and wrote an article with my analysis and visualization. I
            tried really hard to break down the raw statistics into more digestible
            insights, and it was really cool to get responses from classmates that'd
            read my piece.
