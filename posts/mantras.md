You will be happy or unhappy no matter your circumstances.

There is no life without suffering, so seek pain or be subjected to it.

Why be something when you can be both nothing and everything, unfettered and infinite. To me, what I do is what I do, not who I am, and it's purpose is to frame my presence.
