## General themes
- Web3
    - Very valuable core utility, but I think people hype it up too much - I like more of the attitude of put our heads down and build stuff
- NFTs and tokens
    - Important for creators monetizing digital assets that couldn’t be owned before
    - Interoperability is cool - can’t really see killer use cases at the moment other than metaverse (see section)
    - Otherwise, they can represent any sort of ownership on the web, but we already have systems that are not bad for this - email confirmation for real life stuff - I think these will just be a moderate improvement to those systems, make things easier in the long-run
    - Really more of a technical primitive that is necessary for many systems to run - tokens and NFTs as markers for someone’s ability to do things on a platform (exists), *and* they also happen to be transferrable and liquid
- Metaverse
    - I don’t think we will have a matrix or ready player one situation, at least for a very long time
        - Absolute requirement: the experience would have to be so good to really rival real life - we probably would need to be able to manipulate the brain/nervous system to a high degree and I have no idea how far we are from doing that
        - And even then I think a lot of the world would have to go to shit for everyone to want to live the majority of their time inside a virtual reality - maybe it’s because the experiences aren’t *that* good yet, but right now (and I believe going forward) enough people really value real life - begs the question, if virtual reality gets good enough, what if it could feel more real than real life?
        - One view of it’s purpose would just be this haven of pure pleasure - this I think would be like people getting addicted to drugs or video games, and I don’t think this will really take over the world
    - Another possibility is that it’s this reality where we have to power to manipulate and change things more easily, and so we can create a sort of utopia where it’s very similar to normal life, but we can create better systems
    - Maybe there’ll be many realities, one for different communities who want to live/run things in their own way - virtual nation states with the swiftness for change as quick as code
- Blockchain platforms
    - Bitcoin as a base layer for financial system, ethereum still as the main hub for decentralized internet ecosystem
    - Coexistence with different currencies, tokens, etc.
    - Most other blockchains will probably be more like complementary layers or use case specific
    - Most people do not interact with the blockchain directly, usually many layers up
- Open transparent collaborative culture
    - DAOs and social tokens are already kind of in play - forums, discords, other online communities, reputation points and other stats - these just allow for an interoperable and liquid system
    - The bigger shift I think is the culture of transparency and collaboration amongst platforms and major systems
        - Moving away from big tech companies, closed data, blackbox algorithms, and neglected privacy
        - And in bigger systems like the economy and government - open auditable financial base layer, transparent government systems (i.e. things like vote counts and funding distribution)


## Other scratch paper
- Most projects are really not *that* important. The really important themes I see are
    - Untouchable (community decided) monetary policy and decentralized verifiable settlements base layer. Core aspects for why Bitcoin is sound money.
    - Ownership and decentralization of data. Because the services we use are centralized, in order to use their core functionality, we have to abide by whatever malicious side effects they decide, i.e. mass collection of our data, black box discovery algorithms, etc. 1 Content should be public on a base layer, and anyone should be able to access it and build platforms on top of it. 2 We should deliberately decide when to give permission to collect our data.
    - Adoption.
- Some things I realize now are not as revolutionary as I thought
    - Ponzis - seems like a lot of things are sort of a ponzi these days...
        - Usually it’s okay, just a natural phenomenon in a free market, when there’s some underlying utility to an asset - but some things are truly just ponzis
    - A lot of web3 projects - I feel like people just use decentralization as marketing hype for their project/token. There a many occasions where issuing a project with a token could totally be run on a centralized service and it wouldn’t really make a difference except for the fact that the token will be more easily liquidated when the project is on a blockchain, like the token is just an in-game resource/mechanic.
    - A lot of web3 projects 2 - jack dorsey saying how “you don’t own web3,” how VCs are major holders of a lot of projects and things are not really decentralized. This is kinda fair. Look at one of the hallmark projects of ethereum, Uniswap. The vast majority of tokens are held by the creators, and the project is mainly dictated by them. Now think of how that’s run versus how bitcoin is run. Can both of these really be considered decentralized?
        - The thing is, how else should they be run? Not everything can or should be decentralized. When should it? And if you want to move fast (which is necessary in many cases), everything can’t be voted on and discussed with the entire community. It makes sense for bitcoin governance to be extremely slow, because a core aspect of it is that the monetary policy should be practically static. For many projects however, that’s just not the case.
        - Feels like because uniswap is dealing with a bunch of people participating, governance should be more decentralized. But also if people don’t like how it’s run, they can always fork it and/or move to another platform...
- What does decentralization mean?
    - When we classify a certain protocol as decentralized, we do it for a certain reason.
    - When we really want a transparent underlying financial settlements layer, we might consider barrier for entry to verify or participate in the network as an important factor. In the case of a sound money system, we want this, and so the block size of bitcoin is important to be capped. This is not as important for others like Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, that are trying to scale their base layer and run computations and many many transactions—although “decentralization” is still important to them.
- Some good products that are centralized, but generally seem to not violate the values of the web
    - Discord, telegram, substack
- Most governance should be off-chain
    - Bitcoin governance is all off-chain - slow and sometimes difficult, but still ultimately community run
    - It is really inconvenient to do a lot of governance on-chain
    - On-chain only really necessary for moving funds atm
    - In the future it could be good for auditable voting, i.e. elections
- I realized I knew very little, decided to be really bullish on things despite this fact, and now realizing I should be more considerate of my opinions.
    - I became super bullish on Olympus because my high level understanding was that it was the solution to mainstream crypto adoption through crypto-native stability. Recently I’ve seen how Bitcoin is so disruptive as a money because it does things differently from how things are currently done, and OHM is fundamentally different from it. These days I’m leaning towards Bitcoin becoming the global settlements layer, but when I found out about OHM I basically succumbed towards the hype.
    - Now I’m trying to be less bullish so easily. I still want to be positive and open to interesting ideas, but if I’m in love with a project without *that* much knowledge of it, it’s probably because of hype. And I’d prefer to like something because I really believe in it (backed by solid research) instead of just riding the bandwagon.
    - I like to put my money in what I really believe in, and now I have a bunch of money in gOHM and believe in it a lot less, *and* it’s depreciated quite a bit. I planned to hold it long-term, but now realize maybe the timeline of my planned holding should be correlated with how much time I spend researching it and believing in it before putting money in.
    - To clarify, I didn't just totally ape into it, I learned a solid amount of how it worked,
    but I realize now I don't have enough economic context to confidently come to a conclusion
    on whether a certain cryptocurrency is fit to be money.
- Things worth working on
    - Research, education, writing
    - Decentralized content and social media
    - Scaling solutions for major blockchains
    - Products/tools to help adoption
        - Some random ideas - 1 stripe and/or plaid for crypto - make it easier for people to build crypto payments into their online services, 2 subscription/repeated payments with crypto
- I’m not as conventionally ambitious as I thought
    - I don’t care about networking a ton or just jumping in to make tons of money if I don’t believe in the work or the product. I think I'm more about the fulfillment of learning and building and trends long-term.
